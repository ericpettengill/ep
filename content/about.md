Hi! 

I'm Eric and currently work at Caterpillar, Inc. as a Sr. Data Scientist building digital 
products using IIoT data. Previously, I was a graduate teaching assistant at 
Western Michigan University while completing my Master's in Statistics. 

In my free time I enjoy playing golf and trying new foods/restaurants!
